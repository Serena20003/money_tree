The stock is poised for moderate growth over the next three months.  Several factors support this projection.

First, the technical indicators reveal a positive trend. The upward trajectory of the OBV (On-Balance Volume) from 2021 to 2024 signifies consistent buying pressure, suggesting strong investor confidence.  
Although specific values for recent months are unavailable, the established trend indicates continued positive momentum.  
Additionally, while the provided stock data is limited, the increase in key metrics like Free Cash Flow (FCF) between 2022 and 2024 signals improving financial health, further bolstering positive price action.

Second, sentiment analysis, while fluctuating, reveals an overall positive bias.  While negative sentiment spikes exist, the frequency and magnitude of positive scores outweigh the negative ones.  
This suggests the prevailing market narrative surrounding the stock is optimistic, creating a favorable environment for price appreciation. 
The recent sentiment scores, even with periods of neutrality, are not showing sustained negativity, reinforcing the potential for upward movement.

Finally, the fundamental data, while limited, points towards a healthy financial position. The increase in Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the consistent Return on Equity (ROE) from 2021-2024 showcase operational efficiency and profitability.
These strong fundamentals build a solid foundation for future growth and reinforce the positive outlook derived from the technical and sentiment analysis.

Therefore, based on the confluence of positive technical indicators, generally favorable sentiment, and sound underlying fundamentals, we anticipate the stock price to experience a steady upward trajectory in the next three months. 
Investors should remain attentive to new market data and news releases, but the current outlook suggests a promising period for this stock.
